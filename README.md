# ETL_project
Welcome to my ETL_project repository :slightly_smiling_face:

The goal of this project is to find out the most requested technical skills about Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Data Engineer job postings in California in order for someone to become a Data Professional.

There are 2 files - "get_data.py" and "DataJobsAnalysis.ipynb".

The "get_data.py" file is a Python script.

I use the GoogleSearch API provided by SerpApi to extract data and then load it in 2 databases - SQLite and PostgreSQL.
I use Pandas and SQLAlchemy to connect and load the data to my PostgreSQL database.



The "DataJobsAnalysis.ipynb" file is a Jupyter Notebook.

I use Pandas and SQL to analyze the data and make visualizations.
